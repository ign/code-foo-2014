4. The Bay Bridge

Last year, the Bay Area opened the new eastern span of the Bay Bridge, an earthquake certified upgrade to the previous span. The trip
from Oakland to SF still joins 3 major interchanges through a toll booth, and meters people through traffic lights to merge 16 lanes of traffic
down to 5, with maximum effort for safety, while still attempting to minimize delays.

    A. Everyone:

        Explain your thought process for the following:

        A i. How many vehicles cross the bridge, daily, towards San Francisco?

        A ii. How many people does this translate to?

        A iii. How many gamers make the crossing?


    For the following questions 5-8, choose any of the assumptions at the bottom of the page you wish.

    B. Front End:
        Given the Lane Diagram linked above,

        B i (First Level): Design and layout a visual representation of this model for a web page.

        B ii (Next Level): Does it work on all browsers, including my mobile device? Is it responsive?

        B iii (Next-er Level): Can it move?

        B iv (Boss Level): Can it interact?

    C. BackEnd:

        C i (First Level): Write a program for the metering lights that can handle and even distribution of 60 vehicles in 15 lane input,
            and results in 4 "waves" of evenly spaced cars for an output. What is the minimum time to achieve?

        C ii (Next Level): Assume minimum time is unsafe and near collisions inappropriate. What safety measures should be added to the
        code to approximate reality?

        C iii (Next Level): Allow the inputs and outputs to be configurable, add

        C iv (Next-er Level): Offer feedback for min/max levels with/without crashes.

        C v (Boss Level): Add a GUI.


    D.  Database / API:

        D i (First Level): Store and retrieve elements for every vehicle that travel through the lights for each day. Lanes, wait times, car color, etc could be interesting attributes.
        D ii (Next Level): Show how to query for specific elements, sum over days / trips, and normalize attributes for individuals elegantly for the operators running the lights.
        D iii (Next-er Level): Allow editing of specific items, both during and after the fact.
        D iv (Boss Level): Enable a GUI

    E. Bonus Level (all):

    E i: A driver has gained access to a <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/06/watch-dogs-release-date-leaked-in-trailer">Watch Dogs</a>
    type device that allows them control over the metering lights. Assuming the driver wishes to maintain his 50mph cruising speed throughout, and assuming we want to allow
    access to the lights, describe all the assumptions that should be made. For example, assume the lights are wi-fi and therefore have infinite device range.


------------
Assumptions: Feel free to make the following assumption for simplicity, based on rough averages we found from the internet machine.
For your convenience, you may create your own assumptions and comment on the reasoning behind them.
    - 15 inputs / starting lanes (simplified from 16 actual)
    - 5 output / finishing lanes (actual)
    - All vehicles are in a binary state of moving (50mph) or not-moving (0mph), and all start at 0 mph.
    - All vehicles accelerate constantly at 10ft/s2 (<a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/MeredithBarricella.shtml">ref</a> | <a href="http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/conversions/acceleration.php">convert</a> (rounded down)) from 0 mph to 50 mph, the posted speed limit of the bridge
    - A vehicle not first in line is assumed to be instantly first in line if the car in front departs; no need to account for any time / distance before the metering lights.
    - All vehicles are a constant 15 feet length (rounded from <a href="http://www.ask.com/question/what-is-the-average-length-of-a-car">(~5m)</a>
    - The length of road from start to finish is 1000 feet (round number from approx visual inspection of map)
    - All vehicles only merge as implied by the lane configuration determined by the code (simplification).
